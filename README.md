#Introduction

The main idea behind dragtable is to extend the basic HTML table, which will finally allow a user to re-order table columns. After a few searches I encountered dragtable, a JQuery plugin developed by akottr using the JQuery UI Widget Factory. After reviewing the source I noticed that the plugin did not fully meet my requirements. In addition to this I also noticed that some functionality could be further enhanced to improve performance. That is when I decided to fork the original repository and make my own improvements.
