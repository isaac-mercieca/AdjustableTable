{"name":"Dragtable","tagline":"re-order table columns by using drag'n'drop","body":"#Introduction\r\n\r\nThe main idea behind dragtable is to extend the basic HTML table, which will finally allow a user to re-order table columns. After a few searches I encountered dragtable, a JQuery plugin developed by akottr using the JQuery UI Widget Factory. After reviewing the source I noticed that the plugin did not fully meet the requirements I had. In addition to this I also noticed that some functionality could me further enhanced to improve the performance. That is when I decided to fork the original repository and make my own improvements. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n* jQuery\r\n* jQuery UI\r\n  * Core\r\n  * Widget\r\n  * Mouse\r\n  * Sortable\r\n\r\n#Examples","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
